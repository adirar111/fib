# Partial Wang Tiling

These are Wang tiles. For more information, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_tile.

Provided that the third tile (the one with the North and West edges being black, the East edge being green, and the South edge being yellow) is placed down first, there is only one arrangement of tiles such that the tiles tile the infinite quarter-plane. This arrangement forms the Fibonacci numbers. The eleventh tile (the one with the North edge being black and the West, East, and South edges being purple) will appear in Fibonacci-spaced intervals.

The algorithm for this is adapted from https://grahamshawcross.com/2012/10/12/wang-tiles-and-turing-machines/ (with some fixes and optimizations).
